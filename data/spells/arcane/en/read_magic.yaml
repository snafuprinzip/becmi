description: |-
    This spell will allow the spellcaster to read, not speak, any magical words or runes, such as those found on scrofis and other items. A spellcaster cannot understand unfamiliar magic writings without using this spell. However, once a spellcaster reads a scroll or runes with this spell, he can read or speak that magic later without using a spell.
    All spell books are written in magical words, and only their owners may read them without using this spell.
