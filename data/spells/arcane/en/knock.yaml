effect: One lock or bar
description: |
  This spell will open any type of lock. This spell will open any normal or magically locked door (one affected by a hold portal or wizard lock spell), and any secret door (but a secret door must be found before it can be knocked open).
  Any locking magic will remain, however, and will take effect once again when the door is closed. This spell will also unlock a gate, or unstick it if it is stuck, and will cause any treasure chest to open easily. It will also cause a barred door to open, magically forcing the bar to fall to the floor. If a door is locked and barred, only one type of lock will be opened.
