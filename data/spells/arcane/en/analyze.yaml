description: |-
    A spellcaster using this spell can handle one item and learn the enchantment on it. Helms must be put on the spellcaster's head, swords held in his hand, bracelets put on his wrist, etc. for this spell to work. Any consequences of this action (for example, from cursed or booby- trapped objects) fall upon the spellcaster, though he gets his usual saving throws.
    The spellcaster has a chance of 15% plus 5% per experience level to determine one magical characteristic of the item; if the item is nonmagical, his chance is to determine that fact.
    The spell does not reveal much precise information. It will characterize a weapon's pluses (attack bonus) as "many" or "few," will estimate the number of charges on an item within 25% of the actual number, etc.
