effect: One portal or lock
description: |
  This spell is a more powerful version of a hold portal spell. It will work on any lock, not merely doors, and will last forever (or until magically dispelled). However, a knock spell can open the wizard lock.
  The wizard who cast the wizard lock can easily open the door he has enchanted, as can any magic-using character or creature of three or more levels (or Hit Dice) greater than the caster. This sort of door-opening does not remove the magic, and the magical lock will relock when allowed to close (just as with the hold portal spell).
