effect: One creature or object
description: |
  This spell will make any one creature or object invisible. When a creature becomes invisible, all items that he carries and wears also become invisible. Any invisible item becomes visible again when it leaves the creature's possession (dropped, set down, etc.). A light source (such as a torch) may be made invisible, but the light given off will always remain visible.
  If the spellcaster makes an object invisible that is not being carried or worn, it will become visible again when touched by any living creature.
  An invisible creature will remain invisible until he or she attacks or casts any spell.
