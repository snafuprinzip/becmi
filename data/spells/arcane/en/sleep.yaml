description: |-
    This spell will put creatures to sleep for up to 16 turns. It will only affect creatures with 4 + 1 Hit Dice or lessâ€”generally, small or man-sized creatures. The spell will not affect creatures outside the 4 0 ' * 40' area which the player chooses as the spell's target area. The spell will not work against undead or very large creatures, such as dragons.
    When a character is first hit with a sleep spell, falling or sagging to the ground will not wake him up. However, characters affected by a sleep spell are not in a deep sleep. Any sleeping character or creature will awaken if slapped, kicked, or shaken.
    Characters can kill a sleeping victim with a single blow of any edged weapon, regardless of the creature's hit points.
    Your Dungeon Master will roll 2d8 to find the total Hit Dice or experience levels of monsters affected by the spell.
    The victims get no saving throw against this spell.
