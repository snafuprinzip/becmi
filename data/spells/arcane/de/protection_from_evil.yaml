effect: The spellcaster only
description: |-
    This spell creates an invisible magical barrier all around the spellcaster's body (less than an inch away). While the spell lasts, characters and monsters attacking the spellcaster are penalized by — 1 to their attack rolls, and the spellcaster gains a +1 bonus to all saving throws.
    In addition, enchanted creatures cannot even touch the spellcaster! (An enchanted creature is one that normal weapons will not affect, one which only magical weapons can hit. A creature that can only be hit by a silver weapon—a werewolf, for example—is not an enchanted creature. Any creature that is magically summoned or controlled, such as a charmed character, is also considered to be an enchanted creature.) The barrier thus completely protects the spellcaster from all melee or hand-to-hand attacks from such creatures; however, it cannot prevent attacks from missile weapons. Enchanted creatures using missile weapons still suffer the - 1 penalty to the attack roll, but they can hit the spellcaster.
    This spell will not affect a magic missile, either incoming or outgoing.
    If the spellcaster attacks (hand-to-hand) an enchanted creature during the spell's duration, the spell's effect changes slightly. Enchanted creatures are then able to touch the magic-user, but still suffer the attack roll penalty; the penalty and the spellcaster's saving throw adjustments still apply until the spell duration ends.
