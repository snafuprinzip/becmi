description: |-
    This spell will magically hold shut any portalâ€”for example, a door or gate. A knock spell will open the hold portal. Any creature three or more Hit Dice greater than the caster (and characters three or more levels higher) may break open a held portal in one round, but the portal will relock if allowed to close within the duration of the spell.
    Example: Any 5th level character can break through a hold portal spell cast by a 2nd level spellcaster.
