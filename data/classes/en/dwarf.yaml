  - id: Infravision
    name: Infravision
    minlevel: 1

    description: |
      Infravision is the ability to see heat (and the lack of heat). Dwarves have infravision in addition to normal sight and can see 60' in the dark.
      Infravision does not work in the presence of normal and magical light. With infravision, warm things appear red, and cold things appear blue.
      A creature could be seen as a red shape, leaving faint reddish footprints. A cold pool of water would seem a deep blue color.
      Characters with infravision can even see items or creatures the same temperature as the surrounding air (such as a table or a skeleton), since air flow will
      inevitably show the viewer their borders, outlining them in a faint lighter-blue tone. Until they move, they will be very faint to the
      eye; once they start moving, they become blurry but very obvious light-blue figures.
      Infravision isn't good enough to read by. A character can use his infravision to recognize an individual only if they are within 10' distance...
      unless the individual is very, very distinctive (for example, 8' tall or walking with a crutch).

    description: |
      Dwarves can sometimes detect traps (specifically, traps built into stone-work or heavy construction, not other types of traps such as rope-traps in the forest or spring-out needles built into a jewelry box); they can also detect sliding walls, sloping corridors, and new constructions.
      If your dwarf character wants to search for such things in an area, tell the DM. You have 1 chance in 3 to find them. The DM will roll 1d6, and a 1 or 2 will indicate success if there is anything to find; a result of 3-6 means your dwarf detects nothing. "You may check once for each trap, sliding wall, sloping corridor, or new construction.
      Ybu must tell the DM if you want to look for anything; the detection is never automatic.

  - id: Lance Attack
    name: Lance Attack
    minlevel: 1
    table: ""
    description: |
      If a character is on a riding steed (such as a horse) and is using a lance, he can perform the lance attack if his mount runs (flies, swims) for 20 yards or more toward the fighter's target.
      The character gets his Strength and magic adjustments to the attack roll and damage with the lance attack maneuver. The lance, if it hits, will inflict double damage with a successful hit—roll the damage for the lance, multiply the result by 2, and then apply all appropriate adjustments. Without enough room to charge—if the mountmoves less than 20 yards or is stationary—the lance does normal damage only.
      Fighters, dwarves and elves can use a lance attack, but no other character class can do so. If a character has the multiple attacks maneuver, he may choose the lance attack maneuver for any attack he makes in a round. However, he cannot hit the same target time after time; he must choose a new target along his mount's line of movement for each attack, and therefore he must be capable of hitting each target with an attack roll of 2.
  - id: Set Spear vs. Charge
    name: Set Spear vs. Charge
    minlevel: 1
    table: ""
    description: |
      A character on foot and carrying a spear, pike, sword shield, or lance can set the weapon vs. a charge. A charge is when a monster charges the character—that is, runs toward him for 20 or more yards before its attack. A character can also set his spear vs. another character's lance attack against him.
      When the character "sets vs. charge," he holds the weapon firm, braced against the ground and toward the onrushing enemy. The character gets his Strength and magic adjustments to his attack and damage rolls. If the character's attack hits, he inflicts double damage on his target, adding damage adjustments after doubling.
      The character must declare a set spear vs. charge before he is in hand-to-hand combat with the creature charging him. For example, if the character's party wins initiative in the round and the character suspects the monster will charge, he could declare his set spear vs. charge maneuver. Likewise, the characters might see a group of charging monsters several rounds before they arrive, and set their spears against the charge one or more rounds ahead of time.
      Normally, the character makes his attack on the monster's movement phase, when the monster first moves within range of the weapon. If his attack hits and kills the monster, the monster cannot hurt him in return. If his attack fails to kill the monster, the monster will be able to attack on its own hand-to-hand combat phase of the combat sequence.
  - id: Smash
    name: Smash
    minlevel: 12

    description: |
      This is a Fighter Combat Option maneuver, first available at 9th level to fighters and mystics, and at other experience point totals to demihumans (see their experience tables). 
      With this hand-to-hand maneuver, the character automatically loses initiative and takes a -5 penalty to the attack roll (he still gets his Strength and magic adjustments to his attack roll).
      If attack hits, the character adds his Strength bonus, magic bonuses, and his entire Strength score to his weapon's normal damage.
  - id: Parry
    name: Parry
    minlevel: 12
    table: ""
    description: With this maneuver, the dwarf does not make any attack roll. Instead, he blocks incoming attacks for the entire combat round; all enemies attacking him suffer a —4 penalty to hit him with melee and thrown (but not missile) weapons.
  - id: Disarm
    name: Disarm
    minlevel: 12
    table: ""
    description: This maneuver can only be used when the dwarf attacks a weapon-using opponent. The dwarf gets his normal Strength and magic adjustments to his attack roll. If he hits, he inflicts no damage. Instead, the victim rolls 1d20, minus his Dexterity bonuses, plus his attacker's Dexterity bonuses. If the final roll is greater than the victim's Dexterity score, the victim drops his weapon. A dwarf annot use the disarm option against a giant-sized opponent.
  - id: Multiple Attacks
    name: Multiple Attacks
    minlevel: 12
    table: ""
    description: |
      In melee combat, if the Dwarf can hit his opponent with an attack roll of 2 (modified by all bonuses), he can make two attacks per round against that target (three per round at attack rank K).
      Each attack of a multiple attacks maneuver can be a throw, attack, lance attack, or disarm. A character can mix and match his maneuvers; for instance, a character with three attacks per round could perform an attack, disarm, attack combination against his foe, or throw three knives instead of one. This maneuver applies to ideal circumstances, and the character can use movement or some other action instead of another attack.

    description: |
      Experienced dwarves become more resistant to magic. The dwarf automatically takes only half damage from any damage-causing spell or spell-like effect (such as from a magical item or strange monster powers such as beholders' eyes but not including dragon's breath). 
      Divide the rolled damage by 2 and round down. If the effect allows a saving throw, a successful roll indicates that he only takes 1/4 damage; divide the rolled damage by 4 and round down. (If the result is 1/2 point of damage or less, the character takes 1 point of damage.)
